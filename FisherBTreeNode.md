# Fisher-Information Guided B-Tree Neural Networks  
*A Novel Approach for Distributed Inference with Dynamic Load Balancing*


## Abstract

We propose a novel neural network architecture that combines the hierarchical structure of B-trees with the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for dynamic load balancing in distributed GPU inference. Our approach enables efficient utilization of multiple smaller GPUs (e.g., RTX 3090) instead of fewer powerful GPUs (e.g., A100, H800) through adaptive tree restructuring guided by information-theoretic principles.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional neural network architectures rely on sequential layer processing or Mixture of Experts (MoE) for distributed computation. These often require high-end GPUs and may underutilize smaller hardware.

We introduce a B-tree inspired architecture where:
- Each node represents a GPU-based inference unit
- Early exit mechanisms based on confidence thresholds
- Dynamic tree balancing using Fisher Information
- Distributed processing across smaller GPUs

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Fisher-Information B-Tree Architecture

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a B-tree with nodes $\mathcal{N} = \{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\}$.

Each node $n_i$ is defined as:

- $n_i = (f_i, \theta_i, \tau_i, \mathcal{F}_i, \text{GPU}_i)$  
- $f_i : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^c$ is the node function  
- $\theta_i$ are the parameters  
- $\tau_i$ is the confidence threshold  
- $\mathcal{F}_i$ is the Fisher Information Matrix  
- $\text{GPU}_i$ is the assigned GPU

### 2.2 Forward Pass with Early Exit

For input $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$:

```math
h_i = \text{FeatureExtractor}_i(x)  
p_i = \text{Softmax}(\text{ConfidenceHead}_i(h_i))  
c_i = \max(p_i)
\tau_i^{\text{adaptive}} = \tau_i \cdot \left(1 - \alpha \cdot \frac{\text{tr}(\mathcal{F}_i)}{\sum_j \text{tr}(\mathcal{F}_j)}\right)
